# Meal-planner

## Overview

Plan your meals for the week with this ADVANCED meal planner! This planner allows you to choose a starting day and length of the plan. 
It also takes into account that meals can provide leftovers that you can eat on subsequent days; perfect for busy uni students.

For more information please look at my blog @ https://ryanbradshaw.dev/blog/mealplanner/

## Future work

The issues and future improvements are listed at the top of the Python file. I will outline them here too:

* ! Entering too few meals (planner_length) will result in an error
* TODO Allow the user to select days when they know they can't make a new meal
* TODO Write the meal plan to a file (or maybe a spreadsheet) so it can be presented better and stored for future use
* TODO Allow user to remake the meal plan if they want to at the end of the program
* TODO Move the dinner_list to a separate file
